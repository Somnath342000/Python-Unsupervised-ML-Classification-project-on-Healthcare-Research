Classification
Goal: Predict a categorical output (discrete class labels) based on input features.
Algorithms:
Logistic Regression: A linear model used for binary classification tasks.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): A classifier that finds the hyperplane that best separates data points of different classes.
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): A non-parametric algorithm that classifies data based on the majority vote of its neighbors.
Decision Trees: A tree-like model that splits the data into branches based on feature values to make decisions.
Random Forests: An ensemble method using multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy.
Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, assuming independence between features.
Neural Networks: Deep learning models that can classify data with multiple layers of computation.
